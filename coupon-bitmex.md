#### About BitMEX

BitMEX is a cryptocurrency derivative platform. You cannot buy altcoins or bitcoin on BitMEX with your national currency, you can only trade their products for profit. You get your winnings paid out in BTC.

Currently the most traded products are BTC futures, ZEC futures and BTC permanent swap (derivative mimicking spot BTCUSD market). In addition to that, BitMEX is the platform where you can bet on any upcoming event in the crypto markets - the betting market for the COIN ETF was up in February 2017.

Leverage is dynamic between 1x and 100x.

Fees are changeable - depending on the market and whether you're long or short.

The exchange doesn't serve US customers. However there is no verification other than a claim from the user on sign up. The exchange is accessible from a VPN or from the Tor network.

**There is an initial 6 months 10% fee discount for users who sign up at BitMEX with a referral code.**
