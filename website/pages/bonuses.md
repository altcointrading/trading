description: List of referrer codes and offers that will give you a fee rebate.
---


This is a list of referral codes and sign up offers that will give you a benefit, like rebate on fees on exchanges or free trial on products.

All these offers come from what we have tried ourselves.

That said, we do try businesses that are still no-name and new. It is probably a variant of _the Columbus syndrome_. Therefore we append links to Reddit discussions so that you can assess the risk. Suit yourself.

### Free credit for cloud hosting for your trading servers or websites about trading

{% aff DigitalOcean https://m.do.co/c/5ae2def361e8 %} giveth you 10 USD and {% aff Vultr https://www.vultr.com/freetrial/?ref=6873921 %} 50 USD in free credit.

I didn't want to say trading _bot_ in the title as server people tend to see bot as something inherently malicious. But yeah you can run trading bot on a VPS.

### Bitfinex referral code - 10% off fees

Bitfinex is one of the largest bitcoin exchanges out there. It has the largest BTCUSD volume, pretty much only chinese exchanges are bigger. The company was founded by iFinex and is legally based in Hong Kong.

It is not the most transparent company. However, they don't demand more from their customers - there is no need for AML/KYC if you are willing to only withdraw cryptocurrencies. Ideal for altcoin trading and long term hodling.

From altcoin markets you can get reasonable liquidity only on Litecoin markets but if you are a holder, you could put your coins in margin swaps. On Bitfinex you don't need to be verified to participate in Bitcoin lending, nor to sell and lend out USD (this market has higher interest rate).

Fees are beautiful - 0.1% on maker orders, 0.2% on taker orders, 15% on margin swap earnings.

### Virtual credit card Wirex (E-Coin) - 25% off

Virtual credit cards are convenient if you want to spend fiat money fast or if you want to sell bitcoin without AML/KYC or trusting someone on LocalBitcoins. With a VCC you simply send in the coins, wait for 6 confirmations and use the bitcoin to top up your virtual or plastic card.

While with Shift card (by Coinbase) you are only able to top up bitcoin that is exchanged to fiat as you make a card payment, **with Wirex you can sell your bitcoins when the price is high enough and hold the fiat until you decide to spend it**.

What you get with Wirex is a regular Master Card, it is a prepaid card though. Be aware that some merchants don't accept prepaid cards. You can still use it to verify your PayPal or Skrill wallets. It comes handy if you want to get your bitcoin earnings into PayPal money but don't want to trust a third party or, again, LocalBitcoins.

Virtual credit card is available both in online and plastic version. On Wirex you will only be able to verify a plastic card. The card can be sent to an address that is different from the one you verify it for. That is convenient if you travel.
