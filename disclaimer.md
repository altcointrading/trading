**Risks of trade in cryptocurrencies**

With the trade in cryptocurrencies significant risks are involved. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and are accepted only to a limited extent for making purchases. Cryptocurrencies do not represent a claim on any issuer or by any third party and they have no intrinsic value. Due to various causes, the value of cryptocurrencies may be wholly or partially lost. The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by supply and demand and can fluctuate significantly.

**No supervision**

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any government, and trade in cryptocurrencies is not regulated. Nor trading cryptocurrencies falls within the scope of the Act on Financial Supervision (Wft). If you trade in cryptocurrencies the Act on Financial Supervision (Wft) therefore offers no protection.

Any form of deposit guarantee is not applicable to cryptocurrencies or funds that are held temporarily through trading platforms. Wallets can not be compared with a bank account in this context.

**Risks of Internet trading**

Trading in cryptocurrencies via the Internet brings special risks. Such as technical - or transfer problems that may occur when using a computer, tablet, smartphone or similar device, malfunction of the Internet or the network or systems of CleverCoin or other service providers concerned that can prevent or suspend their services on which the trading relies. Also, maintenance on trading platforms may prevent access to it.

Also the information exchange between a computer, tablet, smartphone or similar device with the platform can be intercepted, data or access codes can be copied or imitated by methods such as hacking or piracy, which can lead to loss of cryptocurrencies or funds.

There is no guarantee that none of these risks will be realized.
